# Breast cancer diagnosis predictor

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis app is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart and displays the predicted diagnosis and probability of being benign or malignant. The app can be used by manually inputting the measurements.
